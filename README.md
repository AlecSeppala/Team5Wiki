Assignment 2: Build a Wiki as a team

We have learned that a  "wiki" is a web site designed to let many different users share and publish content. Wikipedia is the most famous example. There are also many smaller wikis for a variety of purposes. In this activity, you will create and share wiki pages with your classmates on GitHub. 

The wiki should feature some technical topic of interest to your group. Below are some suggested ideas

Topics:

1. Machine Learning (ML)
2. The Evolution Of Linux
3. Artificial Intelligence (AI)
4. The Evolution of Windows
5. The Difference between High-Level and Low-Level Languages
6. Ways Our Online Data Can Be Compromised, And How To Minimize The Damage
7. BACS, BAS, AAS, Certificate, Code Camp, Self-Taught...Which One To Choose And Why
8. What Stack Should I Choose, And Why
9. What is The Best Version Control System (VCS) For My Project And Why
10. Anything from these Canvas pages: History of Operating Systems, Popular Operating Systems
 

Assignment Deliverables:

  1.A team/group GitHub repository for the assignment
  2.A multi-page wiki (one page per group member)
    •Must include a Table Of Contents with links to each team member's page
    •Must have a home page that states topic of the wiki, as well as a brief summary of the contents
  3.Final Deliverable is the URL of the home page. ALL GROUP MEMBERS MUST TURN IN THE LINK SEPARATELY!

Roles:

Your group may or may not want to consider assigning/volunteering for one or more of the following roles for this wiki project:

  •Team Lead
  •Editor
  •Researcher
  •Repo/Wiki Owner
  
The above list is in no way comprehensive, nor does it represent concrete roles that MUST be assigned.

Performing a specific role DOES NOT mean that you do not have to write a wiki page in addition to your role.

Even though this is a group assignment, each team member will be graded individually based on their contribution to the wiki (their page).

Bare bones example - your assignment requires more!
